# The 1st MICCAI Workshop on Human-AI Collaboration (HAIC)

## Overview

The success of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in dynamic, real-world healthcare environments increasingly depends on effective collaboration between AI and human healthcare experts. Despite the rapid advancement of AI, significant questions remain regarding the role of human factors and the establishment of best practices for human-AI collaboration.  

**The 1st MICCAI Workshop on Human-AI Collaboration (HAIC)** offers the first systematic discussion forum addressing all aspects surrounding **human-AI interaction, collaboration, and human factor modeling** for the MICCAI community. Through this workshop, we aim to raise awareness about human-AI collaboration in MIC and CAI and spark discussions on identifying and addressing frequently overlooked challenges that involve human factors in MIC and CAI. 

The workshop will be held in conjunction with the [28th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention](https://conferences.miccai.org/2025/en/default.asp) at Daejeon Convention Center, Daejeon, South Korea.

## Call for Papers

We call for original, unpublished works that cover innovative methodologies, validation, application, or best practices for human-AI interaction, collaboration, and human factor modeling in medical image computing and computer-assisted interventions. Please find it below a non-exhaustive list of themes and topics.

### List of Themes

**Human-AI collaborative approaches and joint decision making**

- Interactive predictors (e.g., interactive classification, detection, and segmentation)
  
- Human-AI collaborative/assistive agents and agent systems

**Medical procedure analysis for human skill understanding and augmentation**
  
- Image/video analysis, interpretation, and action modeling for imaging and/or intervention procedures

- AI-assisted guidance and navigation for imaging and intervention

- Agents and agent systems inspired by human behaviors and specializations

- AI-assisted medical text mining

- AI-accelerated medical science: hypothesis generation, experiment planning, implementation, and outcome interpretation

**Emerging techniques for natural human-AI interaction and communication**

- Multimodal models that incorporate textual information (e.g., for medical question answering, diagnosis, and/or treatment planning)

- Incorporating human-friendly inputs: (e.g., natural language, audio, gesture, and gaze)

- Conversational models

- Patient-facing models

**Human-in-the-loop model training**

- Active learning approaches and applications

- Incorporating structured/unstructured human feedback (e.g., natural language instructions, preference labels) in training

**Boosting transparency, interpretability, and risk management for joint human-AI systems**  

- Explainable medical AI and/or its impact on joint decisions

- Reasoning-empowered models

- Out-of-distribution management, hallucination mitigation, uncertainty communication, and decision-deferrals

- Learning to safeguard AI and human users

**Interactive environments for clinical training, education, and human-AI teaming outcomes**

- AI assistants for medical education

- Simulation environments for clinical training and skill enhancement.

- Virtual/augmented/mixed reality applications for HAIC

**Design and assessment for joint systems and workflows**

- Constructing new evaluation datasets  

- Identifying new clinically accepted evaluation metrics or gold standards

- Case study on existing human-AI joint workflows

**Applications: involving any of the above elements**

### Author Guidelines
**Format:** Submissions are required to follow the same [format](https://conferences.miccai.org/2025/en/PAPER-SUBMISSION-GUIDELINES.html) as specified for the MICCAI 2025 main conference: a maximum of 8 pages of main content, with up to 2 additional pages for references. All submissions should follow the Springer LNCS [LaTeX](https://conferences.miccai.org/2025/files/downloads/MICCAI2025-LaTeX-Template.zip) or [Word](https://conferences.miccai.org/2025/files/downloads/MICCAI2025-Word-Template.zip) template. 

**Review Process:** All submissions will undergo a double-blind peer-review process by multiple reviewers. 

**Presentations:** All accepted submissions will be invited for in-person poster presentations. A selected subset of works will be invited for oral or spotlight presentations. The decision on presentation format will be based on the reviewers' overall feedback and ranking. 

**Workshop Proceedings:**: 
Workshop proceedings with be published with the [Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs).
